## Lesson 2.1 : Modifying or making your work easier- understanding gem and using the colorize gem

- installing gem
- using

so far what I have learn about gem, is that basically it’s a code, and that it is built by code which is a gem too, so you need to use gem to built gem, and I also learnt that there are gem which isn’t built by gem, as in the first gem. after the first gem appear it sort of spread in branches like a tree when people started to built more gem, so there is no limit to it. What it basically do from what I understand is that it help programmer in their work, making their work for them easier depending on which gem they install and use, e.g. age calculator, colorize (making what you type to come out in other color), bmi calculator , AKA ( help you to create shortcuts to your cmd in terminal).

￼

For now we will install colorize and see for ourself what does, first we go to ruby gem website and search for it.

￼

Remember that whatever you want to install on terminal you have to type it the way it is to prevent any mistake or error, so the best way to do that would be to copy and paste from the code from wherever you are finding, i believe it's not 100% that there won't be any errors from doing it this way as there are cases like bugs in the code from what I learnt, but the percentage of you making errors by copying and pasting is significantly lower. After we copied we can paste it in terminal and install it.

￼

Once you have install remember to type in GEM LIST to check whether the gem you have install is inside

￼

After installing it, you can go find the documents available, once inside you can see that there are library folder, test folder, and many other different files(don't worry even if we don't understand it now but as time goes by we will) :

￼

To see the mode, features and usages to understand more of what you are downloading you can go to the readme file :

After that’s done you can go into the text editor, for me I am using atom, and once you’re there, type in require  ‘colorize’ , there are many different things you can try out with this gem, we'll try them one by one to see how it goes:)
For the first one you can print out the word/strings in different color, for now we will just type puts “hello, world” .blue/ yellow/red and show you the different example :

There you have it, there are many different possibilities you can do just on one gem alone, imagine what else you can do once you learn more about others.
