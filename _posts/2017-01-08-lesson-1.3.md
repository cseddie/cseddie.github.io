## Lesson 1.3 : creating files- Learning to create file/multiple file on terminal using atom text editor

First, we will have to open terminal and run the atom app from there, so once you are in terminal, type in this cmd : atom first.rb , since we are using ruby as the programming language, we have to remember to type in the extension .RB so it will know e.g:
￼

After you have executed this cmd, atom window should pop out:
￼

From here, we can type in the type of file that you want to create and the number of files you want to create, in this case for now we will create one file first:
￼

After that’s done, remember to press cmd + S to save it, and go back to terminal and type in the cmd : ruby first.rb and press return and your file will be there :
￼

Lets say we want to create 10 files, then the number 1 we can replace it with the word “number”, and on the first row we will put “number = 10” to make things easier :
￼

And with this we try the same thing again, we save it and we go back to terminal and type in “ruby first.rb” :
￼

if you notice, no matter how many times we type in the same cmd, only one file is there,  the problem here is that if you remember from my previous note that says the computer won’t create multiple file of the same name, that’s why in this case, we will have to put in variables, so that you can create files with different name, we can start by going to file name and type in this symbol “#” and you will get something like this :
￼

And from there you can type in variable, just remember that you have to type in the same beside the word “do” and it has to be the same, if you type index both will have to be index, for now we will type in variable :
￼

Now we can try again from the terminal, and this time we should get it right =)
