Lesson 1.1 :introduction to terminal-learning to navigate around terminal using commands

i am going to list down the cmds and its explanation and provide a screenshot of the website that I found which explain it and history of what I learnt ytd, I know it's a little redundant but I hope through this way I will get a better understanding of it and in remembering it, But for those that explain itself i will save the trouble of doing it.
