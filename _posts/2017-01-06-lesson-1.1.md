Lesson 1.1 Eddie programming lesson

Lesson 1.1 :introduction to terminal-learning to navigate around terminal using commands

i am going to list down the cmds and its explanation and provide a screenshot of the website that I found which explain it and history of what I learnt ytd, I know it's a little redundant but I hope through this way I will get a better understanding of it and in remembering it, But for those that explain itself i will save the trouble of doing it.

Cd = change directory e.g cd desktop / cd .. etc

.. = previous level of directory e.g if my pwd is /users/chungsoonaw/desktop .. will bring me to one level before my current directory

Ls = list down the stuff you have in your current directory

-r = recursive or recursively for this I've found a simple explanation which let me understand it :)

Mv = move or you can rename files using this cmd e.g mv app/ app2 or mv first.ruby first.ruby2 or mv app/ Desktop

Cp = copy e.g cp -r app/ app2  or cp first.ruby first.ruby2
notice that when I cp it ,it has to be a different name cause not allowed to have identical files or folder

Rm = remove files or folder e.g rm -r app or rm first.ruby and if I have multiple files or folder to remove e.g rm -r app app2 app3 or rm first.ruby first.ruby2 first.ruby3 etc

Pwd = the path of the directory that you are currently in e.g of a pwd : user/chungsoonaw/Desktop/

Touch = create new file e.g touch first.ruby
