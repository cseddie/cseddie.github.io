- installing aka gem
- exploring the uses of aka gem

Continuing from where we left off about using gem, this gem aka basically helps you to create alias or shortcuts for your cmd that you type in terminal or command line, for this gem you can only use it in terminal. By right, to set alias for your cmd in terminal, you should type in this cmd "nano /.bash_profile, it will open up nano which is a text editor for terminal :

 After you key in return you should be nano :

￼

And from there you can edit your alias, but to save the trouble of doing it you can just install aka and you can create, edit, destroy and find permanent alias in a few simple step on terminal, thus, making your job easier since being a programmer, you have to spent a lot of time on the keyboard typing.

Ok let's install it and explore what it can do:)
If you’re not sure of the cmd you can type in “aka -h” to see a list of all the helpful cmd to help you out :

￼
**note** you notice that there are short alias for the cmd for you so you don’t have to type in the full word so you can save a lot of trouble which is good.

You can type in “aka list” to see the list of alias that you have created or edited, currently we have 2 alias that was create during our last lesson :

Lets create a few more and try it out ourself :

After we’ve created them we can go and check whether its there :

And lets try out the cmd and see if it works :

Ok so everything works, now let us try other cmd out too :

So thats about what we learn from the last lesson for aka, which from my short experience is very useful since it can save me alot of trouble and the pain of typing a lot=)
