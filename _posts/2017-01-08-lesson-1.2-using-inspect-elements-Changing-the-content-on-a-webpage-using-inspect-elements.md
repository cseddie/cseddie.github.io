- using inspect elements

- changing content on a webpage

To start to change the content on the webpage which I want, first i need to go to the webpage and select the content which I want to change, once I am on the webpage I will need to choose the option inspect elements :

![screenshot][id]

ï¿¼

And after I open it, it will pop out a small window below e.g :

![screenshot][id2]

[id2]:/images/Lesson1.2/Photo2.png

there are two ways which we can choose the contents to change or edit :

1 : I can move my cursor to the small window below and find which of the content on that webpage I want to edit.

2 : I can move my cursor to the crosshair on top of the small window and and click it and just find the content which I needed to change.

After I have chosen the content which I want, I just need to edit it in the window below e.g

![screentshot][id3]

note : the content that I change e.g  name or picture on facebook is only viewable by me alone , the person whose name which I change will be able to see what I have change or edit.
