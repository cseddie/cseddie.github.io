<ul>
  <li>
    <p>using inspect elements</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>changing content on a webpage</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>To start to change the content on the webpage which I want, first i need to go to the webpage and select the content which I want to change, once I am on the webpage I will need to choose the option inspect elements :</p>

<p><img src="/images/Lesson1.2/Photo1.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>ï¿¼</p>

<p>And after I open it, it will pop out a small window below e.g :</p>

<p><img src="/images/Lesson1.2/Photo2.png" alt="screenshot" /></p>

<p>there are two ways which we can choose the contents to change or edit :</p>

<p>1 : I can move my cursor to the small window below and find which of the content on that webpage I want to edit.</p>

<p>2 : I can move my cursor to the crosshair on top of the small window and and click it and just find the content which I needed to change.</p>

<p>After I have chosen the content which I want, I just need to edit it in the window below e.g</p>

<p><img src="/images/Lesson1.2/Photo3.png" alt="screentshot" /></p>

<p>note : the content that I change e.g  name or picture on facebook is only viewable by me alone , the person whose name which I change will be able to see what I have change or edit.</p>
