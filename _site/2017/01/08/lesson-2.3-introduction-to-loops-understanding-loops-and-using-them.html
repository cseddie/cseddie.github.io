<p>this topic will be short and simple to understand, this time we will be talking about loop and what’s a loop you ask? :</p>

<p>￼
As you see above, It should be quite clear cut by the way it describe loop in programming term, basically it meant that what ever your instruction in the text editor it will keep on doing it until the condition is met, so lets try it now and see for ourself :</p>

for the number of times, we will put 10 for now, so for 10 times it will print out the strings “hello, world” then it stop, which is our condition, as you know “do” basically means it will do it and “end” means to stop, so after thats done we save it and head to terminal and try :</p>

<p>Ok that works, what about 100 times? Lets try=)</p>

<p>ok that works too, I believe there’s no limit to how many times you and do it. We can create files or folder like that too, which makes things easier, but for the first lesson when we tried creating too much files it sort of made this laptop hang so I think we will skip that now, and thats a simple loop for you. Easy right?=)</p>
