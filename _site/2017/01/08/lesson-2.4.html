  <li>how to use while loop</li>
  <li>difference between loop and while loop</li>
</ul>

<p>This topic we will be talking about while loop, the different between a while loop and a loop is that for loop, the number of time you want your instruction to run need to be stated there and you just execute it and it will run the script until your condition is met. For while loop, it’s a different case, from what I read online, it saids that you use it when you don’t know the number of time you want to run it,  but you set other condition and until that condition is met it will continue, and they use something called the “boolean expression”
￼</p>

<p>Lets try it out for ourself to understand.</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>If you see above, the “while” means the condition which is what I said at the start, until this is met it won’t stop. We will put the condition later for now we will type in the strings that we want to print.
￼</p>

<p>Lets set the condition now</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>As you can see above, beside the variable there is this two symbol “!=“ ! simply means NOT and = means equal or asign,
lets say if number is false we will simply put “number != true” it means in another word that number IS NOT true.
Lets say that number is true this time we will type out “number == true” which means number IS true. on another example, something true cannot be false, if I put in “true == false” this statement will produce to be not true because it is not possible for something true to be false or vice versa. In the case above that we type out it means “while number is not equal to 0”
The script above is not complete but lets save it and try it out anyway to get a better understanding.</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>Ok it doesn’t work but why? as you can see from what the computer say,  because we didn’t state the number of time we want to print it that is why it’s not able to print, we did not DEFINE the variable “number” So lets do it this time.</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>We set it to 10 and save it and head back to terminal.</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>Well it works! But somethings bit off this time, in that we had to stop it if not it will go on and on, I think we found out something cool and there are two problem here, the first would be because we did not state the variable which we mention from the first lesson, and because it is not stated, then there will not be 0 so it would just go on and on, the second problem we will talk about it later, now lets try it out again.</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>This time it works too but it only showed 10 and went on and on, this is the second problem that I am going to mention, this time we want it to go on a decending order and stop when I reach 0, so what do we do?</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>so with this the variable will go on a descending order, lets try again.
￼</p>

<p>It works the way we want this time=) anyway this time lets try another interesting thing, on the above because I put “number - 1” so it will stop once it reach 0, let try - 2 this time</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>Ok so it will minus 2 every time, lets try - 3.
￼</p>

<p>￼</p>

<p>Because we minus 3, its not going to reach 0 so it will not stop until we stop it, with this you roughly get the idea=)</p>
